/**
 JS has a prototypal behaviior, it keeps going up to the parents, grandparents until it finds or whatever it wants to find null i guess
 In the arrow function we can't access this because of the prototype itself. Prototype gives us the access to new, classes, this, prototypal inheritance.

 Everything is Object in JS, eg-> Array, String, function/methods
 __proto__ is an inbuilt property that allows you to access the prototype of an abject directly.
